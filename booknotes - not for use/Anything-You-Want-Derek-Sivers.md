	  Business is not about money. It’s about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 71
	  **Success comes from ==persistently improving and inventing==, not from persistently promoting what’s not working.**
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 76
	  **Make yourself unnecessary** to the running of your business.
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 77
	  The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so **do only what makes you happy**.

	  But revolution is a term that people use only when you’re successful. Before that, you’re just a quirky person who does things differently.
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 135
	  **When you’re onto something great, it won’t feel like revolution. It’ll feel like ==uncommon sense==.**
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 143
	  **==Instead of trying to create demand, you’re managing the huge demand==.**
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 144
	  **Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what’s not working.**
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 148
	  **Don’t waste years fighting uphill battles against locked doors. ==Improve or invent until you get that huge response==.**

	  Anytime you think you know what your new business will be doing, remember this quote from serial entrepreneur Steve Blank: “No business plan survives first contact with customers.”
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 181
	  Never forget that **absolutely everything you do is for your customers**. Make every decision—even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone—according to what’s best for your customers. **==If you’re ever unsure what to prioritize, just ask your customers the open-ended question, “How can I best help you now?” Then focus on satisfying those requests.==** [[Oct 2nd, 2024]]

	  **It’s counterintuitive, but ==the way to grow your business is to focus entirely on your existing customers==. ==Just thrill them, and they’ll tell everyone==.**

	  Starting small puts 100 percent of your energy into actually solving real problems for real people.

	  To me, **==ideas are worth nothing unless they are executed==**. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 222
	  That’s why I don’t want to hear people’s ideas. I’m not interested until I see their execution.
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 245
	  Instead, imagine that you have designed your business to have no big clients, just lots of little clients.
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 312
	  Just **==stay focused on helping people today==**.
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 325
	  **==Never forget why you’re really doing what you’re doing. Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn’t that enough?==**

	  **A business is started to solve a problem. But if the problem were truly solved, that business would no longer be needed!**
	  Note:I could promote this idea. We're in business to get out of business. Except that there are always new parents. Always new kids. #business

	  **That’s the Tao of business: ==Care about your customers more than about yourself==, and you’ll do well.**
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 357
	  It’s another Tao of business: Set up your business like you don’t need the money, and it’ll likely come your way.

	  Several years ago, one guy tried to light his shoes on fire on a plane. Now, and for all future time, millions of people a day have to queue up to take their shoes off at the airport—because of that one dumb moment.
		- Note:Sad and true

	  When one customer wrongs you, remember the hundred thousand who did not. You’re lucky to own your own business.
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 377
	  **Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person’s mistake.**
		- #mw We don't need rules to deal with one-offs. Only 2+ offs.

	  But please know that it’s often **==the tiny details that really thrill people== enough to make them tell all their friends** about you.

	  Even if you want to be big someday, remember that **you never need to act like a big boring company**. Over ten years, it seemed like every time someone raved about how much he loved CD Baby, it was because of one of these little fun human touches.

	  But the whole point of doing anything is because it makes you happy! That’s it!

	  While I was away, my company grew from $1 million to $20 million in four years, and from eight to eighty-five employees.

	  **==There’s a big difference between being self-employed and being a business owner==. Being self-employed feels like freedom until you realize that if you take time off, your business crumbles. ==To be a true business owner, make it so that you could leave for a year==, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left.**
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 647
	  Never forget that you can **==make your role anything you want it to be==**. Anything you hate to do, someone else loves. So find that person and let her do it.

	  **When I had twenty employees, I vowed to keep it that small, but customer demand kept growing,**
		- Note:Love this #mw I need to stop worrying about size. Focus on customers and see where things go.

	  Make sure you know what makes you happy, and don’t forget it.

	  Trust, but verify. Remember it when delegating. You have to do both.

	  I’m happier with five employees than with eighty-five, and happiest working alone. Whatever you make, it’s your creation, so make it your personal dream come true.
