  Title:: Amusing Ourselves to Death
  Notes:: in progress
- ## Summary
- In *Amusing Ourselves to Death*, Neil Postman argues that television has changed truth. When the telegraph first brought us the "news of the day," it dignified largely irrelevant information. Television amplified this information stream. And "serious television" ‚Äî news programs and the like ‚Äî is the Trojan Horse that ensured truth-telling would be rooted in "dangerous and absurdist" trivia. We have much to talk about but little to act upon. TV has become "theatre for the masses," a jumble of slogans easily forgotten that we consume like Aldous Huxley's "soma." TV caused "our public discourse [to] become dangerous nonsense." Rather than appeal to understanding, performers ‚Äî politicians, pundits, presenters, influencers and we ‚Äî appeal to passion. We live in a "peek-a-boo world," in which context is gone and history is forgotten. Content appears and disappears, and voting becomes "the next to last refuge of the politically impotent." Television is our culture now. We swim in a sea of irrelevance and incoherence, endlessly informed of it yet impotent to change it. The solution is not to use media to educate, but to use education to control media.

	- We are all, as Huxley says someplace, Great Abbreviators, meaning that **none of us has the wit to know the whole truth, the time to tell it if we believed we did, or an audience so gullible as to accept it.**
	-
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 303
	- In this sense, all culture is a conversation or, more precisely, a corporation of conversations, conducted in a variety of symbolic modes. Our attention here is on how forms of public discourse regulate and even dictate what kind of content can issue from such forms.
	-

	- You cannot use smoke to do philosophy. Its form excludes the content.
	-
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 312
	- **The shape of a man‚Äôs body is largely irrelevant to the shape of his ideas** when he is addressing a publi**c in writing or on the radio** or, for that matter, in smoke signals. **But it is quite relevant on television**.

	- **television gives us a conversation in images, not words.**

	- **You ==cannot do political philosophy on television==. Its form ==works against the content==.**

	- **I do not mean that things like fires, wars, murders and love affairs did not, ever and always, happen in places all over the world. I mean that lacking a technology to advertise them, people could not attend to them, could not include them in their daily business.** #profound

The ==news of the day is a figment of our technological imagination==. It is, quite precisely, a media event.**

	- **Eternity ceased to serve as the measure and focus of human events.

	- **Besides, we do not measure a culture by its output of undisguised trivialities but by what it claims as significant.** #profound #mw ==So while Gilligan's Island is mindless fun and noone believes it isn't, the DNC isn't necessarily some higher form if the medium of communication is such that gravitas is lost==.

	- **Thus, Athens becomes a metaphor of intellectual excellence, wherever we find it; Hamlet, a metaphor of brooding indecisiveness; Alice‚Äôs wanderings, a metaphor of a search for order in a world of semantic nonsense.**

	- **As Walter Ong points out, ==in oral cultures proverbs and sayings are not occasional devices: ‚ÄúThey are incessant==.** They form the substance of thought itself. Thought in any extended form is impossible without them, for it consists in them.‚Äù

	- People like ourselves find great appeal in Socrates‚Äô plea because we are accustomed to thinking of rhetoric as an ornament of speech‚Äîmost often pretentious, superficial and unnecessary.

	- T**o the Greeks, rhetoric was a form of spoken writing. Though it always implied oral performance, its power to reveal the truth resided in the written word‚Äôs power to display arguments in orderly progression.**
	-
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 543
	- **To disdain rhetorical rules, to speak one‚Äôs thoughts in a random manner, without proper emphasis or appropriate passion, was considered demeaning to the audience‚Äôs intelligence and suggestive of falsehood.**
	- Note:This forms good advice

	- We must remember that Galileo merely said that the language of nature is written in mathematics. He did not say everything is.
	-
	- Yellow highlight | Location: 566
	- For most of human history, the language of nature has been the language of myth and ritual. These forms, one might add, had the virtues of leaving nature unthreatened and of encouraging the belief that human beings are part of it. It hardly befits a people who stand ready to blow up the planet to praise themselves too vigorously for having found the true way to talk about nature.

	- **‚ÄúSeeing is believing‚Äù has always had a preeminent status as an epistemological axiom, but ‚Äúsaying is believing,‚Äù ‚Äúreading is believing,‚Äù ‚Äúcounting is believing,‚Äù ‚Äúdeducing is believing,‚Äù and ‚Äúfeeling is believing‚Äù are others that have risen or fallen in importance as cultures have undergone media change.**

	- **==My argument is limited to saying that a major new medium changes the structure of discourse==; it does so ==by encouraging certain uses of the intellect==, by ==favoring certain definitions of intelligence and wisdom==, and by demanding a certain kind of content‚Äîin a phrase, by ==creating new forms of truth-telling==.** #[[podcast club]]

	- **I will say once again that I am no relativist in this matter, and that ==I believe the epistemology created by television== not only ==is inferior== to a print-based epistemology but ==is dangerous and absurdist==.**

	- Alfred Bunn, an Englishman on an extensive tour through America, reported in 1853 that ‚Äúpractically every village had its lecture hall.‚Äù[35] He added: **‚ÄúIt is a matter of wonderment¬†.¬†.¬†. to witness the youthful workmen, the over-tired artisan, the worn-out factory girl¬†.¬†.¬†. rushing¬†.¬†.¬†. after the toil of the day is over, into the hot atmosphere of a crowded lecture room.‚Äù**
