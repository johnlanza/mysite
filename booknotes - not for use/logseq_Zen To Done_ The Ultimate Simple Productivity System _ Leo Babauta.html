    <li>Summary</li>
    <li>Key points:</li>
    <li>Setup your *<i>weekly big rocks </i>*ahead of time. Perhaps during my weekly review.</li>
    <li>Have <b>one trusted inbox</b>.</li>
    <li>Develop a distractionless <b>habit of doing</b> what you need to do. This is what is missing from most "to do" programs.</li>
    <li>Notes</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Have one inbox at home for all mail, papers from work, school papers, phone notes, computer printouts, schedules, and more. Have four email services? See if you can forward them all to one service. <b>The fewer inboxes you have, the better.</b> Aim for 4-7 inboxes if possible.<p>		  Yellow highlight | Location: 251<br/>		  Each week, list the Big Rocks that you want to accomplish, and schedule them first (more on that in a moment). Each day, create a list of 1-3 Most Important Tasks (MITs - basically your Big Rocks for the day) and be sure to accomplish them. <b>Do your MITs early in the day to get them out of the way and to ensure that they get done.</b><br/></p></li>
      <li>Yellow highlight | Location: 274<p>		  The "Habit of Do" is the key to the ZTD system. It's the habit that's missing from many other productivity system, and yet it's the most important. All the rest is just busy work if you don't actually do the things on your to-do list.<br/></p></li>
      <li>Yellow highlight | Location: 278<p>		  The result? Things don't actually get done. <b><mark>Single-tasking</mark> and focus are the keys to execution.</b><a>#profound</a><a>#life</a><a>[[Aug 23rd, 2024]]</a><br/></p></li>
      <li>Yellow highlight | Location: 281<p>		  Before you get started, eliminate all distractions. Shut off email, cell phone, Internet if possible (otherwise just close all unnecessary tabs), clutter on your desk, anything that might interrupt you.<br/>		  Yellow highlight | Location: 299<br/>		  Don't let yourself check email (or whatever reward works for you - something that you need to do every day) until you do at least 10 minutes (or 15 or 20, it doesn't matter) on the task. Set a timer. Once your 10 minutes is up, set another timer for 5 minutes and do email. Then repeat.<br/>		  Yellow highlight | Location: 305<br/><b>If you can't find anything exciting about a task, consider whether it's really important or not - and if not, find a way to not do it. Sometimes eliminating (or delegating or delaying) the task is the best option. #mywords Can also use <a>[[sam harris]]</a> advice that you put all your attention into the task.</b><br/>		  Yellow highlight | Location: 446<br/>		  During your weekly review, figure out the most important tasks that you'd like to accomplish over the next week. Those are your Big Rocks. Now place them on your schedule, first thing in the day, on different days of the upcoming week. Make those the most important tasks each day, and do them first - don't let them be pushed back to the end of the day.</p></li>
